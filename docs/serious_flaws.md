# Serious Issues Identified in GoSales Engine

1. **Command-line entry points ship without `click`, so they crash immediately.** Operational CLIs such as `gosales/pipeline/run_leakage_all.py` are implemented with `click` decorators and expect the library to be available. Because the dependency list does not include `click`, production runs terminate with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'click'`.
2. **The fallback whitespace scorer leaks future behavior.** When models are missing, `generate_whitespace_opportunities` queries the entire `fact_transactions` table with no cutoff filters (see `gosales/pipeline/score_customers.py:1100`). Post-cutoff purchases then inflate scores and explanations, violating leakage guardrails documented for the pipeline.
3. **`score_all` hard-codes stale training windows and cutoffs.** The orchestrator fixes the label cutoff to `2024-06-30` and trains every division on the static list `["2023-03-31", "2023-09-30", "2024-03-31", "2024-06-30"]` (see `gosales/pipeline/score_all.py:270`). These values ignore the configurable `run.cutoff_date` and any newly ingested data, so running the pipeline today retrains on outdated horizons unless developers edit the source code before every release.
