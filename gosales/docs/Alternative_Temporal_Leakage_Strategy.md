## Problem Context and Current State

### The GoSales Engine Mission

The GoSales Engine is a sophisticated division-level ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) and whitespace analysis system that:

- **Ingests sales transaction data** from Azure SQL databases
- **Builds curated star schemas** (`fact_transactions`, `dim_customer`)
- **Engineers temporal features** as of specified cutoff dates
- **Trains calibrated models** per product division
- **Generates ICP scores and whitespace rankings** for sales teams

### The Temporal Leakage Crisis

**Symptoms:** Models showing "suspiciously accurate" predictions, with Shift-14 tests IMPROVING performance instead of degrading.

**Key Metrics from Current Leakage Reports:**

#### Printers Division @ 2024-12-31 Cutoff
- **Baseline AUC:** 0.9340
- **Shift-14 AUC:** 0.9600 (**+2.60% improvement**)
- **Lift@10:** 7.5963 → 8.5105 (**+12.0% improvement**)
- **Leakage Status:** **FAIL**
- **Masked LR AUC:** 0.6372 → 0.6304 (slight degradation - good)
- **Masked LR Lift@10:** 2.8311 → 2.9840 (**+5.4% improvement - concerning**)

#### Solidworks Division @ 2024-12-31 Cutoff
- **Baseline AUC:** 0.8304
- **Shift-14 AUC:** 0.9404 (**+13.2% improvement**)
- **Lift@10:** 4.4904 → 6.8655 (**+53.0% improvement**)
- **Leakage Status:** **FAIL**

#### Current Model Performance (Production Metrics)
```
Division     | AUC     | Lift@10 | Brier   | Status
-------------|---------|---------|---------|--------
Printers     | 0.9340 | 7.5963 | 0.0058 | FAIL
Solidworks   | 0.8304 | 4.4904 | 0.0447 | FAIL
Simulation   | 0.9700 | 8.9755 | 0.0080 | Unknown
Services     | 0.8961 | 6.7629 | 0.0156 | Unknown
```

**The Smoking Gun:** Moving the training cutoff **earlier by 14 days** should make predictions **worse**, not **better**. This is mathematically impossible in a well-functioning system.

### Current Remediation Attempts

The team has implemented extensive fixes following GPT5-Pro's recommendations:

1. **GroupKFold by customer_id** to prevent cross-customer leakage
2. **SAFE mode** dropping adjacency-heavy features during audits
3. **Purge/embargo gaps** (45 days) between train/validation
4. **Window masking** to lag temporal aggregations
5. **Complex Blocked + Purged GroupKFold** schemes

**Results:** Still failing with reduced but persistent leakage.

---

## Critique of Current Approach

### Strengths of GPT5-Pro's Method

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Addresses multiple leakage vectors
2. **ML Best Practices:** Follows established temporal CV literature
3. **Rigorous Audit Trail:** Detailed logging and validation
4. **Production-Ready:** Includes feature flags and rollback plans

### Limitations and Blind Spots

#### 1. **Complexity Overkill**
- **Problem:** The solution requires maintaining multiple CV schemes, complex feature filtering, and extensive configuration
- **Impact:** High maintenance burden, potential for bugs, difficult to debug failures
- **Alternative:** Simpler, more focused interventions

#### 2. **Lack of Causal Understanding**
- **Problem:** The approach patches symptoms without quantifying the underlying leakage mechanisms
- **Impact:** No insight into WHY certain features leak or HOW MUCH they contribute
- **Alternative:** Statistical quantification of leakage sources

#### 3. **Feature Engineering by Subtraction**
- **Problem:** SAFE mode drops many features, potentially discarding valuable signals
- **Impact:** May reduce model performance unnecessarily
- **Alternative:** Engineer features to be inherently robust

#### 4. **Evaluation Contamination Risk**
- **Problem:** Complex CV schemes may introduce their own biases
- **Impact:** False confidence in leakage-free models
- **Alternative:** Model-based leakage detection

#### 5. **Scalability Concerns**
- **Problem:** Each division requires separate tuning of purge days, SAFE thresholds, etc.
- **Impact:** Exponential complexity as division count grows
- **Alternative:** Automated, data-driven parameter selection

## Alternative Strategy Overview

### Core Philosophy

**"Measure, Understand, Fix Precisely"**

Instead of implementing complex preventive measures upfront, focus on:

1. **Statistical quantification** of leakage sources and magnitudes
2. **Surgical interventions** based on data-driven insights
3. **Inherently robust** feature engineering
4. **Model-based validation** of leakage elimination

### Key Principles

#### 1. **Diagnosis Before Treatment**
- Quantify exactly what's leaking and by how much
- Identify root causes through statistical analysis
- Avoid over-engineering based on assumptions

#### 2. **Feature Engineering, Not Feature Dropping**
- Make features inherently resistant to leakage
- Use robust statistics and normalization
- Preserve valuable signals while eliminating noise

#### 3. **Model as Diagnostic Tool**
- Use the model itself to detect systematic biases
- Leverage prediction stability analysis
- Employ ensemble disagreement as leakage indicators

#### 4. **Automation Over Manual Tuning**
- Statistical methods for parameter selection
- Automated feature selection algorithms
- Data-driven threshold determination

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Better Understanding:** Know exactly what's causing leakage and why
2. **More Robust Models:** Features designed to resist temporal leakage
3. **Easier Maintenance:** Fewer moving parts, automated processes
4. **Scalable Solution:** Works across divisions with minimal tuning
5. **Proven Causality:** Statistical evidence of leakage elimination

---

## Phase 1: Statistical Quantification

### Objective
Quantify the exact nature, sources, and magnitude of temporal leakage using statistical methods.

### 1.1 Temporal Autocorrelation Analysis

**Method:** Compute cross-correlations between features and labels at different time lags.

```python
def temporal_autocorrelation_analysis(features_df, labels_df, max_lag_days=90):
    """
    Compute feature-label correlations at different temporal lags.
    Identify features with suspiciously high correlation at short horizons.
    """
    results = {}

    for feature in features_df.columns:
        correlations = []
        for lag in range(0, max_lag_days + 1, 7):  # Weekly lags
            lagged_labels = labels_df.shift(lag)
            corr = features_df[feature].corr(lagged_labels)
            correlations.append((lag, corr))

        # Flag features with high correlation at short lags
        short_lag_corr = np.mean([c for l, c in correlations if l <= 30])
        if short_lag_corr > 0.3:  # Threshold for suspicion
            results[feature] = {
                'correlations': correlations,
                'short_lag_avg': short_lag_corr,
                'leakage_flag': True
            }

    return results
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Which features correlate suspiciously with near-future labels
- Magnitude of correlation decay with temporal distance
- Identification of adjacency-heavy feature families

### 1.2 Granger Causality Testing

**Method:** Test whether past feature values actually cause future label values (vs. spurious correlation).

```python
def granger_causality_test(feature_series, label_series, max_lag=10):
    """
    Test if feature Granger-causes labels (predictive vs. spurious).
    """
    from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests

    # Test if feature helps predict labels
    test_result = grangercausalitytests(
        np.column_stack([label_series, feature_series]),
        max_lag,
        verbose=False
    )

    # Extract F-test p-values
    p_values = [test_result[i+1][0]['ssr_ftest'][1] for i in range(max_lag)]

    return {
        'min_p_value': min(p_values),
        'significant_lags': [i+1 for i, p in enumerate(p_values) if p < 0.05],
        'causality_strength': 1 - min(p_values)  # Higher = stronger causality
    }
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Distinguish between predictive features and leaky ones
- Quantify causal strength vs. correlation strength
- Identify features that are truly predictive vs. just correlated

### 1.3 Feature Importance Stability Analysis

**Method:** Train models on different temporal subsets and compare feature importance rankings.

```python
def feature_importance_stability_analysis(X, y, time_column, n_subsets=5):
    """
    Train models on different time periods and compare feature rankings.
    Unstable rankings indicate potential leakage.
    """
    subset_results = []

    for i in range(n_subsets):
        # Create temporal subset
        subset_mask = create_temporal_subset(X[time_column], i, n_subsets)
        X_subset, y_subset = X[subset_mask], y[subset_mask]

        # Train model and get feature importance
        model = train_model(X_subset, y_subset)
        importance = get_feature_importance(model)

        subset_results.append(importance)

    # Compute stability metrics
    stability_scores = compute_ranking_stability(subset_results)

    return {
        'importance_stability': stability_scores,
        'unstable_features': [f for f, s in stability_scores.items() if s < 0.7]
    }
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Features with unstable importance rankings across time periods
- Identification of features that "work" only in certain temporal contexts
- Quantification of importance volatility

### 1.4 Label Permutation Tests

**Method:** Randomly permute labels within time windows to test for leakage.

```python
def label_permutation_leakage_test(X, y, time_column, n_permutations=100):
    """
    Permute labels within time windows and measure AUC degradation.
    If AUC stays high despite permutation, there's structural leakage.
    """
    baseline_auc = train_and_score(X, y)

    permutation_results = []
    for _ in range(n_permutations):
        # Permute labels within time windows (preserve temporal structure)
        y_permuted = permute_within_windows(y, time_column)
        auc_permuted = train_and_score(X, y_permuted)
        permutation_results.append(auc_permuted)

    return {
        'baseline_auc': baseline_auc,
        'permuted_auc_mean': np.mean(permutation_results),
        'auc_degradation': baseline_auc - np.mean(permutation_results),
        'leakage_confidence': compute_leakage_confidence(permutation_results)
    }
```

**Expected Insights:**
- How much predictive power is due to true signals vs. leakage
- Confidence intervals for leakage detection
- Identification of time periods with highest leakage risk

### Phase 1 Deliverables

   - Granger causality test results
   - Permutation test AUC degradation metrics

2. **Leakage Source Analysis**

        # Apply exponential decay
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_robust"] = X[feature] * exponential_decay_weight(X)

        # Add noise to prevent overfitting
        noise_factor = np.random.normal(0, 0.01, len(X))
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_robust"] += noise_factor

        # Remove original feature
        X_transformed = X_transformed.drop(columns=[feature])

    return X_transformed
```

    """
    Apply seasonal adjustment and normalization to medium-term features.
    """
    X_transformed = X.copy()

    for feature in medium_term_features:
        # Seasonal decomposition
        seasonal_adjusted = seasonal_decompose(X[feature])

        # Customer-level normalization
        customer_normalized = normalize_by_customer(seasonal_adjusted, customer_ids)

        # Robust statistics (median instead of mean)
        robust_aggregate = apply_robust_statistics(customer_normalized)

        X_transformed[f"{feature}_seasonal_robust"] = robust_aggregate

    return X_transformed
```

        # Add trend stability metrics
        trend_stability = compute_trend_stability(X[feature])
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_stability"] = trend_stability

        # Add relative change metrics
        relative_change = compute_relative_change(X[feature])
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_relative"] = relative_change

    return X_transformed
```

### 2.2 Momentum-Resistant Transformations

#### Replace Simple Trends with Seasonally-Adjusted Trends
```python
def momentum_resistant_trends(X, trend_features):
    """
    Replace simple momentum with seasonally-adjusted versions.
    """
    X_transformed = X.copy()

    for feature in trend_features:
        # Decompose into trend, seasonal, residual
        decomposition = seasonal_decompose(X[feature])

        # Use seasonally-adjusted trend
        seasonal_trend = decomposition.trend - decomposition.seasonal
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_seasonal_trend"] = seasonal_trend

        # Add trend stability metric
        trend_stability = 1 / (1 + np.std(seasonal_trend.rolling(30)))
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_trend_stability"] = trend_stability

    return X_transformed
```

#### Differenced Features for Stationarity
```python
def create_stationary_features(X, nonstationary_features):
    """
    Create differenced features to achieve stationarity.
    """
    X_transformed = X.copy()

    for feature in nonstationary_features:
        # First difference
        diff1 = X[feature].diff()
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_diff1"] = diff1

        # Second difference if needed
        diff2 = diff1.diff()
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_diff2"] = diff2

        # Percentage change
        pct_change = X[feature].pct_change()
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_pct_change"] = pct_change

    return X_transformed
```

### 2.3 Customer-Level Normalization

#### Relative Change Features
```python
def create_relative_features(X, customer_column, temporal_features):
    """
    Create customer-relative features instead of absolute values.
    """
    X_transformed = X.copy()

    for feature in temporal_features:

        customer_avg = X.groupby(customer_column)[feature].transform('mean')

        # Customer's historical std
        customer_std = X.groupby(customer_column)[feature].transform('std')

        # Relative change from customer norm
        relative_change = (X[feature] - customer_avg) / (customer_std + 1e-6)
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_customer_relative"] = relative_change

        # Customer percentile
        customer_percentile = X.groupby(customer_column)[feature].rank(pct=True)
        X_transformed[f"{feature}_customer_percentile"] = customer_percentile

    return X_transformed
```

#### Rolling Statistics with Robust Methods
```python
def robust_rolling_statistics(X, features, window_sizes=[30, 90, 180]):
    """
    Compute rolling statistics using robust methods.
    """
    X_transformed = X.copy()

    for feature in features:

                lambda x: stats.trim_mean(x, 0.1)
            )
            X_transformed[f"{feature}_rolling_trimmed_mean_{window}d"] = rolling_trimmed_mean

            # Robust std (MAD - Median Absolute Deviation)
            rolling_mad = X[feature].rolling(window).apply(
                lambda x: stats.median_abs_deviation(x)
            )
            X_transformed[f"{feature}_rolling_mad_{window}d"] = rolling_mad

## Phase 3: Model-Based Leakage Detection

### Objective

### 3.1 Temporal Ensemble Disagreement Analysis

**Method:** Train separate models on different eras and measure prediction disagreement.

```python
def temporal_ensemble_leakage_detection(X, y, time_column, n_eras=3):
    """
    Train models on different time periods and measure disagreement.
    High disagreement indicates potential leakage in specific eras.
    """
    era_models = []

    Unstable predictions indicate potential leakage or overfitting.
    """

    }
```

### 3.3 Out-of-Sample Extrapolation Tests

**Method:** Train on early data, test on later data (reverse of normal).

```python
def out_of_sample_extrapolation_test(X, y, time_column, split_ratio=0.7):
    """

    X_train, X_test = X_sorted[:split_idx], X_sorted[split_idx:]
    y_train, y_test = y_sorted[:split_idx], y_sorted[split_idx:]

    # Train and test
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    test_predictions = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

    # Compute metrics
    test_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, test_predictions)

    # Compare to expected performance
    expected_auc = estimate_expected_auc(X_test, y_test)  # Based on feature quality

    return {
        'test_auc': test_auc,
        'expected_auc': expected_auc,
        'auc_anomaly': test_auc - expected_auc,
        'leakage_indication': test_auc > expected_auc + 0.05  # 5% threshold
    }
```

### 3.4 Automated Leakage Scoring System

**Method:** Combine multiple detection methods into a unified scoring system.

```python
def comprehensive_leakage_score(X, y, customer_ids, time_column):
    """
    Compute comprehensive leakage score combining multiple detection methods.
    """
    scores = {}

## Conclusion

### Why This Alternative Approach?

1. **Scientific Rigor:** Statistical quantification provides concrete evidence of leakage sources and magnitudes, unlike the current approach's reliance on complex preventive measures.

2. **Surgical Precision:** Instead of dropping potentially valuable features, we engineer them to be inherently robust while preserving predictive power.

3. **Automated Intelligence:** The system learns from data characteristics to automatically select optimal parameters, rather than requiring manual tuning per division.

4. **Causal Understanding:** We don't just patch symptoms—we understand why leakage occurs and design features that are fundamentally resistant to it.

5. **Maintainable Scale:** Fewer moving parts and automated processes make this approach more sustainable as the system grows.

### Expected Business Impact

- **Honest Model Performance:** Eliminate inflated metrics that could lead to poor business decisions
- **Long-term Robustness:** Models that maintain accuracy as time progresses
- **Scalable Solution:** Works across divisions with minimal manual intervention
- **Scientific Credibility:** Quantified, evidence-based approach to temporal leakage prevention

### Call to Action

This alternative strategy represents a more **scientific, maintainable, and ultimately effective** approach to solving the temporal leakage crisis in the GoSales Engine. By focusing on **measurement, understanding, and precise intervention** rather than complex prevention, we can achieve:

- ✅ **Quantified understanding** of leakage sources
- ✅ **Robust, leakage-resistant features**
- ✅ **Automated, scalable processes**
- ✅ **Proven causality** in leakage elimination
- ✅ **Sustainable long-term solution**

The current approach, while technically sound, risks becoming a complex maintenance burden that provides false confidence. This alternative offers a clearer path to truly honest, robust model performance that sales teams can rely on for critical business decisions.

**Recommendation:** Pursue this alternative strategy as the primary approach, potentially implementing GPT5-Pro's methods as complementary safeguards where needed.
